# CostAwareCR
This is the replication package for our paper "A Multi-Objective Effort-Aware Approach for Early Code Review Prediction and Prioritization".

We provide the necessary data/scripts to replicate our study including: 

1- Python scripts to train the ML models.<br />
2- The results for the validation data.<br />
3- Datasets for the studied projects.<br />
4- R scripts for statistical analysis.<br />
5- The Conda envirement.<br /> 

To run the code of our approach please follow these steps:

1- Clone the the repo.<br />
2- Create the conda environment and install the code's dependencies using the following command: conda env create --name "envname" --file=CostAwareCR_conda_env.yml <br />
3- Activate the created environment.<br />
4- Update the global variables in the code accordingly.<br />
5- Run all the cells.<br />
